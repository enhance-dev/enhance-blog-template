While we've done our best to make this blog template usable right out of the box we assume you will want to customize it to suit your own needs. The following is a set of spots you may want to update before deploying to production.

## Blog Posts

You'll probably want to clear out all the files in `app/blog/posts` since you didn't write them. Any file with the extension `.md` will automatically be added to your blog. The filename should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` (e.g. `2023-03-07-new-post.md`).

In order for the file to be correctly processed it needs to include some frontmatter.

```yaml
---
title: The title
description: A description of your post
published: The date published in the format "Month Day, Year" (e.g. March 7, 2023)
---
```

Then the rest of your post can be any valid markdown including fenced code blocks. For more info on how to add additional languages to the syntax highlighting check out the documentation for [Arcdown](https://github.com/architect/arcdown).

## Styling

When it comes to styling the default HTML elements produces by the Markdown to HTML process you can edit the file `app/lib/markdown-class-mapping.mjs`. This file maps which CSS classes will be added to any HTML element Arcdown processes. Additional styling is provided by the file `/public/css/global.css`. This is a good spot to add additional CSS class definitions to be applied during the conversion process.

## Site Title

There are a few places in the template where you will want to update your site's title:

- In `app/head.mjs` you can set the `<title/>` tag.
- In `app/elements/site-header.mjs` you can set the blog title and subtitle that shows up on every page.
- Finally, in `src/plugins/create-rss-feed.js` you can update the title and description that is included in your RSS feed.
